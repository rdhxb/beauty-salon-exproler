Software Engineer Intern

*Home Task* 

## **🏙️ Home Task: Warsaw Beauty Salon Explorer**

**Context:** You're building the foundation of a local services marketplace. The goal is to collect real data about hair/beauty salons in Warsaw and present it in a simple, usable web application \- from data collection all the way to the browser.

---

### **🎯 What to Build**

This is a full-stack task with three parts: data collection, backend API, and frontend UI.  
As a result, it should be a single fully working application end-to-end.

---

### **Part 1 \- Data Collection**

Collect data on at least **100 Warsaw hair/beauty salons** from any publicly available source (Google Maps, Booksy, Yelp, Facebook, Google Places API, etc. \- your creativity is welcomed).

For each salon, capture as many fields as possible:

Table

| Field | Required? |
| ----- | ----- |
| Name of the business | ✅ |
| Address | ✅ |
| District | ✅ |
| Phone number | ⭐ nice to have |
| Website / social media link | ⭐ nice to have |
| Services offered | ⭐ nice to have |
| Price range | ⭐ nice to have |
| Rating \+ number of reviews | ⭐ nice to have |

**Rules:**

* Store the data in any format: SQLite, JSON, CSV, or a database of your choice

---

### **Part 2 \- Backend API**

1\. Expose the collected data via a simple REST API:

* return the full list of salons (name, district, rating, price range)  
* return full details for a single salon  
* allow modification of single salon details

---

### **Part 3 \- Frontend UI**

A simple web interface that consumes the API:

* A **listing page** \- browse all salons, see key info at a glance (name, district, rating, price range)  
* Basic **search or filter** \- by district or service type (at minimum one of these)

* A **detail view** \- click a salon to see its full details (address, phone, services, etc.)  
* Manual **modification** of details and saving changes in backend storage via API

---

### **📁 Deliverable**

A link to publicly available GitHub repository (preferable) or uploaded archive containing:

* Application code  
* A README.md explaining:  
  * How to run the application  
  * Technical solution and frameworks/tools used  
  * What you'd improve with more time

---

### **🔧 Technology**

Free choice \- any language, framework, or tooling. Kotlin on the backend and React / Next.js on the frontend are a plus, but not required.

---

### **✅ What We Care About**

* **Data quality** \- accurate, consistent, deduplicated records  
* **Code quality** \- readable, structured, maintainable  
* **Product thinking** \- does the UI actually help someone find a salon?  
* **Documentation** \- can someone else run this from scratch?

We care more about how you think and how you work than whether you hit 100 records exactly.

### **⏱️ Time Expectation**

**\~4–8 hours.**

### **❓Be ready to discuss**

* Demo the app \- show it running with real data  
* Why did you choose your data source?  
* How you handled missing or inconsistent data  
* How would you scale the data source to cover all of Poland?
